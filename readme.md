# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

This project is an independent data science exploration focused on analyzing real-world medical insurance cost data using Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset of medical insurance costs. This involves working directly with raw data in a `.csv` file and applying various data analysis techniques to extract insights, perform predictions, and potentially identify trends.

The dataset includes several features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Yearly medical charges

Unlike previous guided projects, this project is self-driven and encourages critical thinking and independent problem solving. It provides an excellent opportunity to apply your existing Python and data science knowledge in a real-world context.

## Key Objectives

- Import and examine the structure and quality of the dataset
- Build and test analysis functions using various combinations of features (e.g., age and smoking status)
- Predict medical charges using linear regression models
- Estimate prediction intervals
- Compare model accuracy and performance across different methods
- Extend the project with new ideas and analysis

## Tasks on the Kanban Board

- [x] Import dataset
- [x] Save processed dataset
- [x] Explore and inspect dataset contents
- [x] Build out analysis and prediction functions
- [x] Define the scope of the project
- [x] Add project extensions (e.g., new features, visualizations)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn *(optional for visualization extensions)*

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python 3 and required packages are installed
3. Run the scripts in order or explore the Jupyter notebook (if provided)
4. Modify or extend the analysis as desired
